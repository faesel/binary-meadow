        question: 'A server is down or slow — does the whole library break?',
        answer:

        question: 'Can I read offline?',

        question: 'How much does OPDSy cost?',
        answer:
          'OPDSy is a one-time purchase on Google Play — buy it once and it is yours on every Android device signed in to that Google account. There is no subscription, there are no in-app purchases or ads, and every feature, including encrypted sync, is included. The Play listing shows the current price in your own currency.',

        question: 'How does sync work, and can Binary Meadow see my library?',
        answer:
          'Sync is optional. If you turn it on, your library, favourites, reading progress, highlights and bookmarks are encrypted on your device with a passphrase-derived key and stored in a hidden, app-private folder of your own Google Drive. Only a device holding your passphrase can read it — neither Binary Meadow nor Google can.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Does the dictionary send my lookups anywhere?',
        answer:
          'No. Dictionaries are downloaded once from Settings and then searched entirely on your device, so a word you look up never leaves your phone — and lookups keep working with no connection at all. Each dictionary file is checked against a fingerprint built into the app before it is installed, so a modified or substituted file is refused.',
      },

        question: 'What is the difference between syncing to Google Drive and syncing to my server?',
        answer:
          'They are separate, and you can use either, both or neither. Google Drive sync carries your servers, favourites, reading progress and annotations between your own devices, end-to-end encrypted. Server-side sync instead publishes the page you reach back to the library itself, so its web UI and any other client show the same place — useful if you also read in a browser. Komga is the only OPDS server that accepts this today, and it is off unless you turn it on per library.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Does OPDSy work on e-ink devices and tablets?',
        answer:
          'Yes. There are independent toggles for a high-contrast black-on-white theme and for switching animations off, to avoid ghosting on slow-refresh screens such as Onyx Boox, and tablets get two-page spreads for both books and comics.',
